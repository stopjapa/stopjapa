Dear Nigerians, Let’s Rethink ‘Japa’


Are you tired of the endless struggle, corruption, and feeling like there’s no hope for a better Nigeria? I know many of us are frustrated with the system—tired of the daily battles, tired of the injustice, and tired of feeling stuck. It’s easy to understand why so many are choosing to ‘japa’ (flee) in search of greener pastures abroad. But before you pack your bags, let me share something personal with you.


My name is Rasheed Abudu, and I am the founder of the STOP JAPA campaign. Recently, I took on the Lagos State Government, the Lagos State Attorney General, and LASTMA in their own court. I was wrongly penalized by LASTMA, and instead of bowing to the usual demands, I decided to challenge them. I didn’t hire a lawyer, and I didn’t pay a single bribe. It wasn’t easy, but I stayed true to my principles—and I won. Yes, right here in Nigeria, without cutting corners or paying anyone off.


This experience taught me something crucial: Change is possible if we refuse to give up and stand our ground. I understand the fear—the fear of insecurity, the lack of job opportunities, and the desire for a better life for our families. But imagine if, instead of running away, we channel that fear into fighting for a Nigeria we can all be proud of.


What if the solution to Nigeria’s problems isn’t somewhere else, but right here, within us? What if we are the change we’ve been waiting for?


Instead of running away, let’s stay and fight for the future we want. Our country needs people like you—brave, talented, and resilient individuals who can challenge the status quo and make a difference.


What if we stayed to hold our leaders accountable?


What if we invested in our communities, started businesses, and created jobs?


What if we built a Nigeria where integrity and justice thrive?


I know it’s not easy. The system seems rigged against us, and sometimes it feels like there’s no hope. But every time we ‘japa,’ we take away the talent and skills that Nigeria desperately needs to grow. We are the change-makers. We are the ones who can transform this nation.


Let’s channel the energy we’re using to leave into transforming our own country. Nigeria is our home—if we don’t fight to make it better, who will?


So before you decide to leave, remember this: If I, Rasheed Abudu, could win against the system without paying a bribe, imagine what we can achieve together if we all stay, stand up, and push for change.


Imagine a Nigeria where integrity and justice aren’t just dreams but our reality. A country where your hard work pays off, where talent is nurtured, and where we all have a chance to thrive.


The grass is not always greener on the other side—it’s greener where you water it. Let’s water our own grass and build the Nigeria of our dreams.


Let’s not give up on Nigeria. Together, we can make a difference.
